# The freetds.conf file is a replacement for the original interfaces
# file developed by Sybase.  You may use either this or the interfaces
# file, but not both.
#
# FreeTDS will search for a conf file in the following order:
#
#     1) check if a file was set programatically via dbsetifile() and
#        is in .conf format, if so use that,
#
#     2) otherwise, if env variable FREETDSCONF specifies a properly 
#        formatted config file, use it,
#
#     3) otherwise, look in ~/.freetds.conf,
#
#     4) otherwise, look in @sysconfdir@/freetds.conf
#
# If FreeTDS has found no suitable conf file it will then search for
# an interfaces file in the following order:
#
#     1) check if a file was set programatically via dbsetifile() and 
#        is in interfaces format, if so use that,
#
#     2) look in ~/.interfaces
#
#     3) look in $SYBASE/interfaces (where $SYBASE is an environment
#        variable)
#
# Only hostname, port number, and protocol version can be specified
# using the interfaces format.
#
# The conf file format follows a modified Samba style layout.  There
# is a [global] section which will affect all database servers and
# basic program behaviour, and a section headed with the database
# server's name which will have settings which override the global
# ones.
#
# Note that environment variables TDSVER, TDSDUMP, TDSPORT, TDSQUERY, 
# and TDSHOST will override values set by a .conf or .interfaces file.
#
# To review the processing of the above, set env variable TDSDUMPCONFIG
# to a file name to log configuration processing.
#
# Global settings, any value here may be overridden by a database
# server specific section
